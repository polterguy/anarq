# Your module folder

This folder contains your modules, and will be used by e.g. the crudifier as the destination folder for your HTTP CRUD endpoints.
In addition, it also contains your _"system"_ module folder, which is an especially protected folder, which you should be **very**
careful with if you choose to mess with, since it contains system files that Magic depends upon to function correctly.
